            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a component of software configuration management that changes different documents, computer programs and large web sites. It is also known as revision control or source control. When a change is made, it is identified by a number or letter code which is referred to as simply a "revision." Each revision goes along with a specific time stamp and is associated with the user that has made the change. Any revision that is made can be either stored, compared, and with some types of files it can be stored. Today, revision control systems are used for software development. Here, a group of people can make changes to the same files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a source code management system that is used for developing different forms of software. Git was designed and developed by Linux kernel developers in 2005. Git is a distributed revision control system that is used for non linear workflows. It emphasizes speed, data integrity, and support. Each Git working directory is a repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities. The design of Git was inspired by BitKeeper and Monotone. Originally, it was designed as a low-level version control system engine where others could wtire front ends. It is not a version control system that can be used directly.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is an on-disk data structure in a revision control system. It stores metadata for a set of files or a directory structure. Based on if the version control system is distributed or centralized, the information that is contained in the repository can be dublicated on each user's specific system and then can be maintained through a a single server. The metadata that the repository contains includes a historical record of changes in the repository, a set of commit objects, and a set of references to commit objects which is called a head. The main purpose of using a repository is that it can store different sets of files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are typically used by differnt people as stand-alone applications. They are embedded in various kinds of softwares. For example, word processing programs and spreadsheets such as Google Docs and Sheets in content management like Wikipedia's Page history. This kind of revision control allows for a user to revert a single document back to a previous revision. This is critical for allowing one editors to track another editor's work. They can also correct someone's previous mistakes as well as defend against vandalism and spamming. Different software tools for revision control are critical for the organization of multi-developer projects.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a repository that resides on a remote server yet can be shared amoung various team members. An example of a remote repository is Github. On the other hand, a local repository is a repository that resides on the local machine of a specific user. For example, Cloud9. A local repository can be created in two different ways. The first way it can be created is to create a brand new repository. The second way is to clone an existing remote repository onto a local machine. When a new repository is created with different files and directories, other developers can make note of their change history and then track their status and versions.</p>
